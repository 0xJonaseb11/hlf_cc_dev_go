Previously, this test verifies that we can load multiple orphaned files as
command-line-arguments packages. In the distant past, we would load only one
because go/packages returns at most one command-line-arguments package per
query.

With zero-config gopls, these packages are successfully loaded as ad-hoc
packages.

-- a/main.go --
package main

func main() {
	var a int //@diag(re"var (a)", re"not used")
}
-- b/main.go --
package main

func main() {
	var b int //@diag(re"var (b)", re"not used")
}
